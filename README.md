openCampaign
============

Ed Lee's experiment with an open campaign for others to participate and more importantly learn for their own campaigns

The goal is to create a framework for like-minded/Internet candidates to succeed in running for Congress as it takes many in Congress to change how things work. Hopefully this can become a resource for campaign logistics and campaign strategy that can cater to the shared Internet support base.
